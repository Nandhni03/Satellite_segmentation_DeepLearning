# Satellite_segmentation_DeepLearning

In this project, I explored techniques to prepare the dataset and preprocess images. Then, I trained a CNN model with a U-Net architecture, with the masks and images from the dataset from kaggle. At the end you can see a comparison between the image, its mask from the dataset and what the model predicted. However, because Google Colab only syupported 10 epochs for this project the model is not very good... I will try more to find a solution for this problem...
